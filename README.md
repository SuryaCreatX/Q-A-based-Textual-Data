# Q-A-based-Textual-Data

Question Answering models can retrieve the answer to a question from a given text, which is useful for searching for an answer in a document.
Time to look at question answering! This task comes in many flavors, but the one weâ€™ll focus on in this section is called extractive question answering. This involves posing questions about a document and identifying the answers as spans of text in the document itself.
